LikeC4 is model-based, and views are projections of the model from various perspectives, scopes, and levels of detail, such as:

-	System/service overviews
-	Component interactions in specific use cases
-	Data flows and sequence diagrams

LikeC4 does not enforce specific rules, such as a strict number of levels or what should be included; it’s entirely up to you and your context.  

## View definition

Views are defined in `views` section.  
They can be named (must be unique) or unnamed (can’t be referenced, but still can be exported):

```likec4
views {
  // with name
  view index {
  }
  // unnamed
  view {
  }
}
```

The view’s name is used as an image filename during export and as part of the URL when sharing, so it’s advisable to define one.

<Aside title="Default view">
  `index` is a special view, and is rendered by default if no view name is specified.  
  If it is not defined - will be generated and include top-level elements
</Aside>

### View properties

Views can have a `title`, `description`, `tags` and `links`:

```likec4
views {

  view epic12 {
    #next, #epic-12
    title "Cloud System - Changes in Epic-12"

    // Description can be Markdown with triple quotes
    description """
      This diagram shows the **high-level**
      components and interactions.
    """

    link https://my.jira/epic/12 'Epic-12'

  }

}
```

Properties must be defined before [predicates](/dsl/views/predicates/).  

## Scoped views

A view can be defined for a specific element (`view of ..`).  
The view will then inherit the [scope](/dsl/references#scope) of that element:

:::note
You will learn about `include` and `exclude` in the [predicates](/dsl/views/predicates/) section.
:::

```likec4
views {

  view {
    include api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is not found
  }

  view of cloud.backend {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, resolves to 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

  view of legacy {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, resolves to 'legacy.api'
  }

}
```

Additionally, a scoped view becomes the default for the element:

```likec4
views {

  view {
    // on click navigates to 'view1',
    // because it is default for 'cloud.backend'
    include cloud.backend
  }

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    include *
  }

}
```

You can define multiple views for the same element, with the default determined by their order.

## Extend views

Views can be extended to avoid duplication, to create a "baseline" or, for example, "slides" for a presentation:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 {
    include *
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    title 'Same as View1, but with more details'

    style * {
      color muted
    }

    include some.backend
  }

  // cascade inheritance
  view view3 extends view2 {
    title 'Same as View2, but with more details'

    include * -> some.backend
  }

}
```

The predicates and style rules of extended views applied after the ones from ancestors.

Extended view also inherits the scope:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    title 'Backend components'
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```
